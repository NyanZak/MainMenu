Main Menu System Guide
==================

This documentation describes how to use the `SettingsMenu` component in your project.

Behaviours
----------

-   \[`AudioManager`\]
-   \[`MainMenu`\]
-   \[`SettingsMenu`\]
-   \[`StopSounds`\]
  
AudioManager
------------------------
This behaviour allows you to store all your audio files in one gameobject, adjusting the files properties and being able to reference them.

### Properties

-   `Sounds` - List that contains all the sounds
-   `Name` - Name of the audio clip to refer to it
-   `Clip` - Location of the audio file
-   `Volume` - How loud the audio is
-   `Pitch` - Adjust the pitch of the audio
-   `Loop` - Decided if the audio clip should loop once it reaches the end
-   `Group` - The Audio group that this clip belongs to, in order to adjust audio levels as a group.

### Script
In order to use audio files we must reference Unity's Audio system.

```
using UnityEngine.Audio;
```
We create a list that stores all the audio files and instance it so that it will be present in all of our scenes, so we can use all the sounds in every single scene, for each audio clip that we add we add some properties that we can later adjust in the Inspector.

```
public Sound[] sounds;
    public static AudioManager instance;
    void Awake()
    {
        if (instance == null)
            instance = this;
        else
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            return;
        }
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
        foreach (Sound s in sounds)
        {
            s.source = gameObject.AddComponent<AudioSource>();
            s.source.clip = s.clip;
            s.source.outputAudioMixerGroup = s.group;

            s.source.loop = s.loop;
        }
    }
```
    
In order to call sounds within other scripts we create a public void with the string which will be our audioclips  `Name`
    
```
    public void Play(string name)
    {
        Sound s = Array.Find(sounds, sound => sound.name == name);
        if (s == null)
        {
            Debug.LogWarning("Sound: " + name + " not found!");
            return;
        }
        s.source.volume = s.volume;
        s.source.pitch = s.pitch;
        s.source.Play();
    }
}
```
   
MainMenu
------------------------

This behaviour allows you to load Twitter with preset messages to promote the game, you can also exit the game and switch to the next scene using buttons.

### Properties

-   `APP_PC_Link` - Link to the site where your game is located.
-   `Twittername Parameter` - Message included in the tweet.

### Script
In order to switch scenes we will need to use Unity's SceneManagement.

```
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
```
We create a few strings that will change what is tweeted for us, we are able to link the game as well as a brief description of it, in order to bring up twitters create tweet we link to its url, and you can even change the language if you or the game are not english.

```
[SerializeField] private string APP_PC_LINK = "INSERT LINK HERE";
[SerializeField] private string twitternameParameter = "Just played GAME TITLE, GAME DESCRIPTION";
private string twitterdescriptionParam = "";
private const string TWITTER_ADDRESS = "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet";
private const string TWITTER_LANGUAGE = "en";
```

A few voids are made which will be mapped onto Button's OnClick event, this allows us to quickly transition the scene to the next one in the build index list, and you can also quit the game at the same time. Using the strings we created we can reference them when loading up the url which will take players to a new window.

```
public void PlayGame()
{
SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex + 1);
}
public void Promote()
{
Application.OpenURL(TWITTER_ADDRESS + "?text=" + WWW.EscapeURL(twitternameParameter + "\n" + twitterdescriptionParam + "\n" + APP_PC_LINK));
}
public void QuitGame()
{
Debug.Log("QUIT");
Application.Quit();
}
}
```

SettingsMenu
-------

This behaviour allows you to change the volume for every single sound as well as specifically the Music and SFX. It also allows you to adjust the games resolution, quality setting and if you want the game to be fullscreened or not.

### Properties

-   `AudioMixer` - The parent mixer object that controls all the games sound
-   `MusicMixer` - Controls the volume of sounds under the musicmixergroup
-   `SFXMixer` - Controls the volume of sounds under the sfxmixergroup
-   `ResolutionDropdown`- Dropdown UI component that allows you to select between all the available resolutions

### Script
In this script we are able to do many things such as load a specific scene and controlling audio while require the usage of UI systems and IEnumerables.
```
using UnityEngine.Audio;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using System.Linq;
using TMPro;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
```

We start by referencing our 3 audio groups, the Audio Mixer which is the parent of both the Music and SFX Mixer has a different reference compared to the childs. We are also making use of TMP to improve the quality of the UI therefore we need to reference the TMPDropdown instead of the regular Dropdown. In order to display all ouf our resolutions we will be creating a list.

```
public AudioMixer AudioMixer;
public AudioMixerGroup MusicMixer;
public AudioMixerGroup SFXMixer;
public TMP_Dropdown resolutionDropdown;
Resolution[] resolutions;
```
Because every computer is different they may not be able to use higher resolutions therefore it would be pointless including them in the List, therefore we will check the available resolutions when the game starts as the user will not be immediately put on the settings menu. In this start function we also set it so that the framerate is the highest possible, this means that if the users machine is capable of 60fps then all the resolutions will be 60fps, this also stops duplicate resolutions from showing every single possible framerate, making it much easier to scroll through the dropdown. 
    
``` 
private void Start()
{
resolutions = Screen.resolutions.Select(resolution => new Resolution { width = resolution.width, height = resolution.height }).Distinct().ToArray();
resolutionDropdown.ClearOptions();
List<string> options = new List<string>();
int currentResolutionIndex = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < resolutions.Length; i++)
{
string option = resolutions[i].width + " x " + resolutions[i].height;
options.Add(option);
if (resolutions[i].width == Screen.width &&
resolutions[i].height == Screen.height)
{
currentResolutionIndex = i;
}
}
resolutionDropdown.AddOptions(options);
resolutionDropdown.value = currentResolutionIndex;
resolutionDropdown.RefreshShownValue();
}
``` 
Using the resolution system we just created as well as using Unity's own settings, we can create multiple voids that we can assign to buttons using OnValueChanged, this can be used to change the volume as you move the sliders.

```
public void LoadScene(int level)
{
SceneManager.LoadScene(level);
}
public void SetResolution(int ResolutionIndex)
{
Resolution resolution = resolutions[ResolutionIndex];
Screen.SetResolution(resolution.width, resolution.height, Screen.fullScreen);
}
public void SetVolume(float volume)
{
AudioMixer.SetFloat("volume", volume);
}
public void SetMusicVolume(float MusicVolume)
{
AudioMixer.SetFloat("musicvolume", MusicVolume);
}
public void SetSFXVolume(float SFXVolume)
{
AudioMixer.SetFloat("sfxvolume", SFXVolume);
}
public void SetQuality(int qualityIndex)
{
 QualitySettings.SetQualityLevel(qualityIndex);
}
public void SetFullscreen(bool isFullscreen)
{
Screen.fullScreen = isFullscreen;
 }
}
```

StopSounds
----------------------------------

Stops all the sounds in the scene playing.

### Properties

-   `Audio Source` - References all the audio sources present in the scene.

### Script
We create a list for AudioSources. In the StopAllAudio void we find all the audio sources in the scene and stop each one playing.

```
    private AudioSource[] allAudioSources;
    public void StopAllAudio()
    {
        allAudioSources = FindObjectsOfType(typeof(AudioSource)) as AudioSource[];
        foreach (AudioSource audioS in allAudioSources)
        {
            Debug.Log("MUSIC STOPPED");
            audioS.Stop();
        }
    }
}
```
